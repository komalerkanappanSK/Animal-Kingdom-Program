Final Project - Animal Kingdom
This assignment will give practice with defining classes. Write a set of classesthat define
the behavior of certain animals. Will be given a program that runs a simulation of a world with
many animals wandering around in it. Different kinds of animals will behave in different ways and defining those differences.

The Critter Simulation Project is a dynamic and interactive simulation of various animal behaviors within a 
2D world with many animals wandering around in it. In this project, object-oriented programming principles are
explored by modeling different sub class of critter(Super class) with unique behavioral patterns using inheritance 
and polymorphism. The critters interact with their environment and other critters (bear,tiger, white tiger, giant 
and ninjacat), showing complex interactions such as movement, infection, and survival strategies. A graphical 
interface for visualization will be integrated into the simulation to allow users to view the behaviors and interactions in real-time.
